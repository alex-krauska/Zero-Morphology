Acceptability Judgement Experiment

Description:
The data was gathered in the fall of 2018 by Alex Krauska. 
Participants were 80 native English speakers on Amazon's
Mechanical Turk. The participants were presented each item
on a computer screen and prompted to provide a rating for
the sentence's "naturalness", on a scale of 1 (completely 
unacceptable) to 7 (perfectly acceptable). The judgements
obtained for each item and condition were collected into
a single mean rating.

Format:
A data frame with 96 observations on 3 variables.

[1] item	Item number
[2] condition	Condition number (21-24)
[3] prompt	The sentence which participants responded
		to
[4] mean_rating	The mean rating (out of 7) given to that
		item and condition
