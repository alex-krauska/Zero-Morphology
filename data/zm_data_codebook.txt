Eye Tracking Experiment: Category Ambiguity

Description:
The data was gathered in the spring of 2018 by Alex Krauska.
Participants were 44 undergraduate students at Northwestern
University. The data was gathered using an EyeLink 1000 
Plus. The participants were presented each item on a
computer screen, and instructed to read as naturally as
possible (silently). After reading the sentence the 
participants answered a comprehension question to ensure that
they had read the sentence fully and thoroughly. For any
item during which the participant blinked at the critical
region (the region of interest in the sentence), the data
was excluded. Participants that had too many trials
excluded were excluded altogether. The data that remained
was converted to a readable format using scripts provided
by the University of Massachussetts, Amherst.

Format:
A data frame with 9859 observations of 11 variables.

[1] subj	Subject number (anonymized)
[2] cond	Condition number (21-24)
[3] item	Item number
[4] value	Fixation time for that observation
[5] region	Region in the sentence (1-3)
[6] fixationtype Type of fixation:
			ff: first fixation
			fp: first pass
			rp: regression path
			tt: total time
			(others are irrelevant to this study)
[7] logRT	Log Reading Time; log(value)
[8] z		z-score relative to the mean for that
		condition (function zscoreET)
[9] mean_rating Mean rating, provided by the acceptability
		judgement data set
[10] derivation Derivation status (derived or underived)
[11] base	Base category of the word (noun or verb)

The original (un-tidied) data set had 16686 observations
of 13 variables. Several variables were relevant in earlier
stages of file conversion and data analysis, but are no
longer relevant to the analysis of the data. Several fixation
types were excluded because we do not expect them to exhibit
any experimental effects.
